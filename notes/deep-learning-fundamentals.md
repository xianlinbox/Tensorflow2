## what is deep learning

* AI -> ML -> DL
* Turning data into numbers, then find the pattern inside it. Then we can use the pattern to predict things.
* Traditional approach: we figure out input & rules, then we get output; ML approach: we have input and expected ouput, the code figure out the rules.
